// Find the longest single-word palindrome within a phrase.

// The sorting implementation required by this particular implementation strategy / outline has been provided in this case, as a convenience. Study it carefully to make sure you can create custom sort functions of your own, later.

// Notes:
// * Use all the functions in the skeleton.
// * If there are multiple longest palindromes of equal length, return the last one.
// * The phrase will only contain letters (no symbols, punctuation, or numbers).
// * Your palindrome detection should be case-insensitive.
